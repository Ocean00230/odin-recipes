            <li>1 tablespoon instant coffee granules</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (375ml) water</li>
            <li>2 cups (440g) caster sugar</li>

            <li>200g dark eating chocolate, chopped coarsley</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten lightly</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (225g) self-rasing flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (150g) plain flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (80ml) cream</li>
            <li>2 x 45g packets maltesers</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to slow (150°C/130°C fan-forced). Grease deep 19cm-square cake pan;line base and sides with baking paper.</li>
            <li>heat butter, coffee, the water, sugar, extract and half of the dark chocolate in a large saucepan, stirring until smooth. Transfer to large bowl; cool 20 minuets. Stir in eggs and sifted ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into pan; bake about 1 hour 50 minutes. Stand cake 15 minutes; turn top-side up, onto wire rack to cool.</li>
            <li>Combine cream and remaining dark chocolate in saucepan, stirring over low heat until ganache micture is smooth. Cover; refrigerate 1 hour r until ganache is firm, just set. using 3cm and 5cm-star cutter, cut as many stars as possible from the white chocolate. Stand about 30 minutes or until firm</li>
            <li>Spread ganache over cake; decorate with stars and maltesers</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A scatter of white chocolate stars and maltesers tops the rich, dark cake well, but you can let your imagination run riot with other chocolate decoration ideas. Cut after-dinner mints into triangles or shards and mix them among the stars. You can also replace the maltesers with chocolate covered nuts or dried fruits - try peanuts or raisins.</p>
