Project: Recipes 30/01/23
Before: This project will help me solidify what of html I have learnt so far. I have so far learnt about elements, tags, how to make lists, ordered and unordered, how to add links and images. This project is a website that will contain multiple recipes for cakes.

After: This was quite fun, I enjoyed it. A lot easier than I thought it was. Though I need to go back through and add the accessibility feature to the images, I couldn't remember how to do it just before.
